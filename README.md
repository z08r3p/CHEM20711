(a)             Answer BOTH parts (i) and   (ii).
(i)             Explain what is meant by the term sustainable development goal. Discuss the need   to   improve   access   to   safe   drinking   water   in   many   parts   of   the   world. (6 marks) 
(ii)          Describe   a   technology   that   is   currently   used   to   produce   drinking   water   by   desalination   of   seawater. (6 marks) 
(b)            Answer BOTH parts (i) and   (ii).Circular   nanofiltration   membranes   of   effective   diameter   3.00   cm   consisting   of   MoS2 nanosheets on aporous support   were   prepared. They   were   then functionalised   with either sunset yellow (SY) dye or crystal violet   (CV)   dye.   Measurements   were   made   of the   volume   (V)   of water   permeating   through   the   membranes   in   a   given   time (t) under external pressure. Ion permeation experiments were   also   carried   out   and   the   % Na+   rejection   evaluated. The   results   of   these   measurements   are   given   in the following table.

(i)               Calculate the water flux in units of   L m−2   h− 1    for each membrane. (8 marks) 
(ii)          Discuss   the   potential   of   these   membranes   for   water   treatment   applications. (4 marks) 
(c)             The 2008 Robeson upper bound for the CO2/ N2    gas   pair is given by the equation:
P = kαn where P is   the   CO2    permeability   in   barrer,   α   is   the   CO2/   N2    selectivity,   and   the   constants k and n have    the    values    30,967,000      and    −2.888,      respectively.      The   following table gives experimental values of P and α for   mixed matrix membranes   of   the   polymer of   intrinsic microporosity PIM-1 in combination with three different   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Determine whether each membrane lies below   or above the 2008 Robeson upper bound. Comment on your results.

2.                  Answer ALL parts.
(a)             Answer BOTH parts (i) and   (ii).
Two zeolites have the respective chemical   formulae:
                                                            Na{(C2H5)4N}x [Al5Si38O86]·20H2O

(ii)          Describe the possible roles   of the   organic ion in   Na{(C2H5)4N}x [Al5Si38O86]·20H2O during formation of the zeolite framework. (5 marks) 
(b)            Answer BOTH parts (i) and   (ii).
(i)             Describe, with   examples,   three   different   types   of   catalytically   active   species that can be introduced into zeoli代 写CHEM20711 CONTEMPORARY THEMES IN CHEMISTRYSQL

(ii)          State,   with   explanation,   and   using   all   the   information   provided,   the   type   of   shape      selective      catalysis      occurring      for    the       following      zeolite      catalysed   reaction.

The   product   distribution   of   the   reaction   is   not   affected   by   varying   the   size   of the zeolite particles.(4 marks)

Plot   the   pore   size   distribution   graph   for   this   zeolite.   Assume   that   no   pores   run   through the solid in any direction   other than that   shown. (4 marks)

biocatalysis by A and B respectively.

(ii)          Suggest      an      arrow      pushing      mechanism      for EITHER the      production      of   compound 1 (mediated   by   biocatalyst A) OR the   production   of   the   final   amide   and   compound 3 (mediated   by   biocatalyst B).   There   is   no   need   to   include   recycling   of   cofactors. (8 marks) 
(iii)       Biocatalyst A was    found   to   have   low   activity   when   tested   with   a   ketone   starting   compound   instead   of the   aldehyde   shown   above.   Suggest   why   this   might be the case and how the activity could be increased. (2 marks) 
(c)             The reaction   catalysed by biocatalyst B can be   performed   at   room   temperature   in   water.
